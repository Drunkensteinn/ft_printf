# ft_printf
ft_printf 42

this project - its a reproduction original <stdio.h> printf's beahavior.
This is my own version, i was using a lost of binary operations, also i was using a dynamical memmory allocations only in a few place.
And ive overtook by speed origin funck. at 3 perc. I was runnig for speed of project, thats why i used a binary operations, one global buff, and one write(unistd.h).
